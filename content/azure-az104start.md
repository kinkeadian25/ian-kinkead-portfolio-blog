The AZ-104 certification is a valuable credential for anyone looking to get more involved in Azure within their organization! It validates your ability to manage cloud services that span storage, security, networking, and compute cloud capabilities. In this blog post, I will share the beginning of my journey of working towards earning the AZ-104 certification!

## Background

I have some experience with Azure concepts and have worked on a few projects. However, I believe that getting certified will not only validate my skills but also open up new opportunities. My end goal is to attain the AZ-305 certification, which is a more advanced level. But, as the saying goes, "A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step." So, I am starting with the AZ-104 certification, as it is required!

## Starting the Journey

I am kickstarting my journey with the [Microsoft Learn AZ-104 Administrator Prerequisites](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/az-104-administrator-prerequisites/). Microsoft Learn provides a structured and comprehensive learning path that covers all the necessary topics for the certification.

## What's Next?

Over the next few weeks, I will be going through the learning modules, practicing with hands-on labs, and sharing my progress and insights here. I believe this will not only help me consolidate my learning but also provide valuable insights for others who are on the same path.
