Here with those post I am announcing my plan to document my journey to master data structures and algorithms. As someone who has dabbled in these concepts and is already fairly efficient, I am determined to take my skills to the next level.

## Daily Blog Posts

To achieve my goal, I have committed to posting one blog entry every day, where I tackle a new problem related to data structures and algorithms. Through these blog posts, I will not only solve the problems but also explain the thought process behind each solution.

## Learning Resources

Throughout my journey, I will be utilizing various learning resources to enhance my understanding of data structures and algorithms. Some of the resources I will be exploring include:

- Online courses and tutorials - Specifically Neetcode.io and Leetcode and Princeton's DSA course
- Books and textbooks - Specifically Grokking Algorithms and Cracking the Coding Interview

## Join Me

I invite you to join me on this exciting journey as I strive to become an expert in data structures and algorithms. Together, we can learn and grow, and I hope that my daily blog posts will inspire and help others who are also on a similar path!
