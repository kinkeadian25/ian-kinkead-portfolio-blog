## Why This Course?

I do already have some familiar with Azure through acquiring my AZ-900, and some light exposure as a developer at my current company. So I wanted to begin my deep learning into architecting things outside of applications with a hands-on approach!

## What I Aim to Learn?

I want to come away from this course feeling confident that I can make design decisions regarding every single layer of a system to support a business. I know I will be far from an expert, but I believe this course will get me to that place where I feel I am as an engineer. If I know what needs to be done, I will know how to do the research to accomplish it in an effective and clean manner!

I also believe this course will help me identify where my weaknesses are in architectural design, and it will help me make decisions on where to focus my more specific Azure and general architecture learning going forward.
