Up In Flames is a fun game where you play as a firefighter using sprinklers to put out fireballs who are trying to set a house on fire. This game was made for a game jam over a week, with the great Eleanor Kinkead making the art!

You can play the game on [itch.io](https://kinkeadian25.itch.io/up-in-flames). Bugs will be found!

The source code for the game is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/kinkeadian25/UpInFlames).

## Tools Used

- **Unity**: A powerful cross-platform game development engine used to create rich interactive 2D, 3D, VR and AR experiences.
- **C#**: The main programming language used in Unity for scripting game behavior.
- **Visual Studio Code**: An integrated development environment (IDE) from Microsoft. Used for the C# scripting in Unity.

## The Complexities of Game Development

- As a full stack developer, transitioning into game development presents a unique set of challenges. Unlike traditional web or software development, game development often involves a blend of complex logic, physics, artificial intelligence, and graphics - all of which need to work together seamlessly to create a smooth and enjoyable gaming experience.

- In this project, one of the main challenges was managing the interactions between the firefighter, the sprinklers, and the fireballs. This required a deep understanding of Unity's physics engine and collision system, as well as the ability to write efficient C# code.

- Moreover, game development also requires a different mindset. Instead of thinking about databases, servers, and HTTP requests, you're thinking about game loops, player input, and frame rates. It's a challenging but rewarding shift that opens up a whole new world of creative possibilities.
