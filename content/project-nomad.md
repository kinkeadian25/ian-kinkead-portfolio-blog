Nomad is a full stack mobile application designed to address the needs of travelers. It allows users to plan vacations and excursions, track costs, and generate reports.

## Tools Used

- **IntelliJ Ultimate**: An integrated development environment (IDE) that provides advanced features and tools for Java development.
- **Java**: The main programming language used for scripting application behavior. It is a versatile and widely-used language in the software development industry.
- **Room Database**: A persistence library that provides an abstraction layer over SQLite, used for data storage. It simplifies the process of working with databases in Android applications.
- **SQLCipher**: An open source extension to SQLite that provides transparent 256-bit AES encryption of database files. It enhances the security of the application's data.
- **Gradle**: A build automation tool used for building, testing, and deploying Android applications. It helps manage dependencies and build configurations.
- **Android SDK**: The Android Software Development Kit (SDK) provides the necessary tools, libraries, and documentation for developing Android applications. It includes the Android platform, emulator, and various development tools.

## The Complexities of Full Stack Mobile Application Development

- As a full stack developer, transitioning into mobile application development presents a unique set of challenges. Unlike traditional web or software development, mobile development often involves a blend of complex logic, user interface design, and data management - all of which need to work together seamlessly to create a smooth and enjoyable user experience.

- In this project, one of the main challenges was managing the interactions between the user interface and the underlying data. This required a deep understanding of Android's activity lifecycle, Room Database for data storage, and Java for scripting application behavior.
