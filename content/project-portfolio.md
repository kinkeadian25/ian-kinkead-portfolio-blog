My portfolio site is back and better than ever! After taking a break to focus on school and work, I've completely rebuilt it using Vue, Nuxt, and Nuxt Content for stateless CMS and blogging.

## Tools Used

- **Vue**: A progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.
- **Nuxt**: A framework for creating Vue.js applications, with a focus on UI rendering and abstraction.
- **Nuxt Content**: A Git-based headless CMS for Nuxt. It allows you to write in a content/ directory and fetch your Markdown, JSON, YAML, XML and CSV files through a MongoDB like API.

## The Journey of a Developer

My motivation behind this is to start a blog and document my journey as a developer. I'm looking to challenge myself and expand my skills beyond building CRUD apps and basic projects with a hyper focus on backend and low-level performance, due to the nature of my current work. My blog will cover everything from improving my data structures and algorithms to experimenting with threading capabilities between Elixir, Go, C#, Rust, and other languages.

## Fun and Games

And if you're interested, there's even a fun brick-breaker game at the bottom of the page! I will be cycling games like snake and pong out as well, as I update my blogs!

I'm excited to share my progress and insights with all of you. Let me know what you think and stay tuned for more updates as I cycle in and out some of my other games. Thanks to NuxtLabs and their Content functionality, I'll be able to easily update my posts with markdown. Cheers to lifelong learning!
